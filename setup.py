# FIXME: Cython doesn't exist on Heroku before pip runs. And this depends
# on Cython. But we can't declare that we depend on Cython because we try
# to import Cython before it exists and promptly exception out. So, we declare
# the dependency above (when pip presumably first loads it to check dependencies)
# and then backtrack and add back the cythonize call after Cython is installed by
# pip and it calls us again to actually install us. This is a glorious, GLORIOUS
# hack but fuck it. It's 01-27 and we're launching in 4 days. JFDI, bitch.
